    I have always lived in the dark, whether it be the mausoleum on my family's property or the hidden thoroughfares in whatever town or city i find myself in at the moment...
</p>
    <p>
    So... maybe that's why I wasn't fazed when I woke up the night after the heist and couldn't see or hear anything. 
</p>
<p>
    I had been hired, along with a cobbled together crew, to rob some eccentric's penthouse... Apparently we weren't looking for anything in particular, just kind of... sending a message... I can't even remember the asshole's name...
</p>
<P>
    But I DO remember seeing that damned crystal.
</P>
<p>
    It was sitting on the desk. Plain as day.
    Like it was an afterthought... and why wouldn't it be? It was big, or bright, or well-cut...
    Any appraiser worth even half his salt would've thrown it out.
</p>
<p>
    I don't know why I took it.
    I don't know why I could hear it literally whispering my name, or why, when I touched it, the house suddenly got darker, as if the shadows were trying to smother us...
    I don't even remember how the rest of the heist went... 
</p>
<p>
    All I know is that when I woke up from the deepest sleep I can remember, I was surrounded by darkness.
    Silent, thick, palpable darkness that felt endless. 
</p>
<p>
    I sat there, in complete, maddening silence.
</p>
<p>
    It felt like an eternity...
    I couldn't take it anymore. 
    I wanted out.
    I screamed, but couldn't hear my voice.
    I was begging to be taken out.
    Somewhere.
    Anywhere.
    Anywhere but in the darkness, anywhere but here, I-
</p>
<p>
    Then I heard it... laughing.
    Grating... yet melodic...
</p>
<p>
    and suddenly I could see...
    It was still dark, I could tell, but somehow I could see perfectly. 
</p>
<p>
    I was in the middle of a black forest, the trees reaching high above, blocking the sky.
    I walked forward, into a clearing... i remember noticing that the sky had no stars.
    She was standing there. Waiting.
</p>
<p>
    She offered me power beyond anything I could imagine, but said it would come with a price.
    Nothing is ever free anyway... and what she was offering was... irresistible to say the least. 
    
</p>
<p>
    Then I actually woke up in the bed I had rented at the local Inn.
    In the years since then... my life has changed. 
    I'm well on my way to becoming the best gods-damned thief anyone has ever heard of... 
    Built myself a name in the underground as the guy you call when someone says the word "impossible."
</p>
<p>
    Sure, I'm bound to... I still haven't learned her name... I really should get on that.
    Only... I haven't spoken to her since that night...
    Now it's some new shadow demon every other week, giving me orders like they run the place.
    It's whatever, I do what they want and I get to keep my power... and the wealth and influence that come with it.
</p>
<p>   
    What could be better?
