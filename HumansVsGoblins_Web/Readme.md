Current "features"

- Home page for adding arbitrary scores (testing POST operations)
- simple scores display

Plans:
- Home screen will show the controls and provide basic information/credits

- Humans vs Goblins tab will lead to the game

- The third tab has been repurposed from a saves screen to a scores screen, and the DB no longer stores save data, but scores instead. 

The goal is wil now be to survive the goblin onslaught for as long as possible. 
Pickups and spawn rules are intended to be the same as my original java-only game. May beef up difficulty a bit more as the player goes on, though.
