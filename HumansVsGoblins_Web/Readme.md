Current Plan:

The SQL DB, and therefore the Spring App backend, will handle keeping track of gamesaves.
The game save will record:
- Goblin
  - Count
  - Location
  - Status
- Human
  - Location
  - Status
  - Equipment

I may (haven't fully decided yet) have the backend also handle storing the images that are used to represent different entities (Human, Goblins, Equipment, Etc.)
